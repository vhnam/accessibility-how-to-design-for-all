## Practical Accessibility: From Tools to Meaningful Inclusion

### History of Accessibility Tools

- Bobby: Early online accessibility checker with a British policeman icon; provided limited, surface-level feedback.
- Early standards: WCAG 1.0 barely existed; practitioners relied on guidelines from Australia and the UK.
- Key limitation: Automated tools created a false sense of security and failed to ensure real accessibility.
- Current state: Online checkers still exist and are better, but remain insufficient on their own.

### Practical Accessibility vs. Compliance

- Compliance: Meeting WCAG or legal standards.
- Practical accessibility: Making experiences sensible, meaningful, and genuinely successful for users.
- Core issue: Passing guidelines does not guarantee quality or usability.
- Goal: Move beyond “meets standards” to creating real value and task success for users.

### Accessibility as Universal Access

- Universal access: A foundational principle of the web, articulated by Tim Berners-Lee.
- Scope: Accessibility applies across the entire user experience, not just websites.
- Three core cases for accessibility:
  - Legal
  - Moral
  - Business

## Legal Case for Accessibility

### Disability Statistics

- United States & UK: ~20% of the population (1 in 5 people) has a disability.
- European Union: ~1 in 7 people.

### Accessibility as a Human Right

- Shift from accommodation:
  - Accommodation: Treated as an add-on or special adjustment.
  - Human right: Accessibility as a core requirement of design and development.

- Modern view: Accessibility is part of good coding and good UX, not an afterthought.

### United States Legislation

- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):
  - Section 508: Governs accessibility of digital content.
  - Section 508 Refresh (2018): Strengthened requirements and emphasized quality and excellence.

- Lawsuits:
  - 250+ lawsuits (2015–2017).
  - High-profile cases: AOL, Target, Charles Schwab, Netflix.

- Motivation: Many companies act primarily due to legal risk and litigation.

### Other US Laws

- 21st-Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (2010):
  - Covers mobile and video accessibility.
  - Lacks clarity between apps, mobile sites, and platforms, creating gray areas.

### European and Global Legislation

- European Accessibility Act (EAA):
  - Covers devices, software, websites, apps, ticketing machines, media, banking, and e-commerce.

- United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities:
  - Reinforces accessibility as a global human right.

- National laws:
  - Many countries adopt WCAG 2.0 / 2.1 as the standard.
  - Nordic countries enforce strict anti-discrimination laws with penalties for inaccessible websites.

## Moral Case for Accessibility

### User Advocacy and Inclusion

- Accessibility extends user advocacy into disability advocacy.
- Focus: The full user journey across physical, digital, and service touchpoints.
- Accessibility barriers often accumulate across channels, not just on websites.

### Discrimination and Social Impact

- Employment discrimination:
  - High unemployment rates among people with disabilities.
  - Significant income disparities.

- Real-world barriers:
  - Inaccessible buildings, broken elevators, inaccessible transportation.

- Compounded challenges:
  - Many users experience multiple disabilities simultaneously.

### Global Perspective

- Accessibility challenges are common in developing countries.
- Example issues:
  - Inaccessible job interviews.
  - Lack of basic infrastructure.

- Localization and translation:
  - Accessibility efforts often include multilingual and localized support.

## Business Case for Accessibility

### Clean Code and Usability

- Accessibility encourages:
  - Structured, semantic HTML.
  - Better usability and clarity.

- User advocacy:
  - Designing with empathy by understanding real user needs.

### SEO and Discoverability

- Accessible sites:
  - Are easier to find.
  - Are easier to navigate.

- Accessibility aligns directly with SEO and usability goals.

### Strategic Value

- Accessibility as a core launch pillar:
  - Alongside usability and SEO.

- Supports:
  - Internationalization.
  - Mobile-friendly content.

### Technology Enablers

- Responsive web design:
  - Built-in inclusiveness across devices and resolutions.

- Modern standards:
  - HTML5 and CSS3 improve native accessibility.
  - ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications): Supports complex web applications.

### Public Relations and Brand Impact

- Poor accessibility:
  - Leads to bad PR and reputational damage.

- Good accessibility:
  - Can be leveraged as positive brand differentiation.

- Examples:
  - Airlines and retailers publicly contrasted based on accessibility quality.
  - Inclusive design used as a marketing and trust signal.
