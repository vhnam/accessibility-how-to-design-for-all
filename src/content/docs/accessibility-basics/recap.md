- Accessibility can improve usability and SEO.
- Good accessibility means services, products and digital user experience is accessible: e.g. images are tagged, forms and headers are accessible, navigation is easy and content is easy to access.
- Poor or non-compliant accessibility forces users into dead-ends, redundant navigation, lost loops, audio clutter and being locked out of content.
