## Designing with Awareness of Bias

This lesson emphasizes recognizing designer bias — especially visual bias and mouse bias. Designers must avoid overly complex layouts, poor color contrast, visual metaphors without labels, and mouse-dependent interactions. Accessibility should be considered at the **design and wireframing stage**, not added later.

Using **grouping or block strategies** helps structure content clearly, define relationships between primary and secondary elements, and create logical reading and navigation flow.

## Focus, Structure, and Content Prioritization

Clear structural hierarchy is critical:

- Prioritize content based on personas.
- Define logical screen flow.
- Ensure alt text supports surrounding context.
- Design visible and customizable **focus states** for keyboard users.
- Avoid mouse dependency.

Backgrounds, text colors, and combinations must meet proper contrast standards.

## Mobile Accessibility Essentials

Mobile accessibility builds on web best practices with additional considerations:

- Allow zoom.
- Ensure large, finger-friendly touch targets.
- Support Bluetooth keyboards.
- Properly label hamburger menus and icons.
- Make sliders, progress bars, carousels, and accordions accessible.
- Ensure custom controls are keyboard and screen-reader friendly.

## VR and AR Accessibility

Emerging technologies like VR and AR must be accessible from the start.

Key principles include:

- Spatial orientation support.
- Clear affordances.
- Use of 3D spatial sound for blind users.
- Avoid visual and height bias.
- Reduce cognitive complexity.

Accessibility must evolve alongside new interaction models.

## Plain English and Cognitive Accessibility

Clear language supports users with cognitive impairments.

Best practices include:

- Using plain, direct wording.
- Preferring action verbs.
- Avoiding jargon and slang.
- Breaking content into smaller sections.
- Using headings and lists for clarity.

Language clarity reduces cognitive load and improves usability for all users.

## PDF Accessibility

PDFs are often inaccessible because they are not properly tagged.

Accessible PDFs require:

- Structural tagging (headings, lists, tables).
- Proper reading order.
- Alt text for images.
- Metadata and language specification.
- Accessible forms and labeled fields.

PDFs must be treated as structured documents, not just visual exports.

## Designing for Aging Users

An aging population requires focused accessibility consideration.

Common needs include:

- Larger font sizes.
- Higher contrast.
- Clear navigation.
- Reduced scrolling complexity.
- Generous spacing.
- Clear instructions.
- Forgiving forms and large clickable targets.

Seniors may read more carefully, rely heavily on instructions, and struggle with troubleshooting. Designers must avoid projecting their own comfort levels onto users.

## Final Takeaway

Accessibility is not a checklist — it is a mindset applied early in design.
From layout structure and mobile controls to VR environments, PDFs, plain language, and aging populations, inclusive design strengthens usability for everyone.
