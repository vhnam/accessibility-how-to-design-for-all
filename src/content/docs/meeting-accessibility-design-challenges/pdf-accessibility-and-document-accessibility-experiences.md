## Why PDFs Are a Major Accessibility Problem

PDFs are widely used for important content like job applications, government forms, reports, and menus. However, most PDFs are inaccessible by default, especially for blind and low-vision users. Without proper tagging and structure, screen readers cannot navigate them, making critical information unusable.

PDF accessibility is often ignored because people assume:

- “It opens, so it works.”
- “It looks fine visually.”

But visual usability does not equal accessibility.

## Why PDFs Break for Screen Readers

PDFs require their own structural tagging system. Without it, assistive technology cannot interpret the document properly.

Common failures include:

- No heading structure (H1, H2, etc.)
- No table of contents
- Incorrect reading order
- Missing alt text for images
- Poor link descriptions
- No form labels
- Missing document language metadata

When this happens, screen readers may:

- Repeat the same text endlessly
- Read content out of order
- Fail to access content entirely

## Core Requirements for Accessible PDFs

PDF accessibility mirrors web accessibility principles. Key areas include:

### 1. Structure & Navigation

- Proper headings
- Lists and tables correctly tagged
- Logical reading order
- Headers, footers, page numbers tagged appropriately
- Table of contents with accessible links

### 2. Metadata

- Meaningful document title
- Correct document language
- Descriptive link text

### 3. Images & Media

- Alt text for images, charts, and formulas
- Transcripts or captions for embedded media
- Accessible linked resources

### 4. Forms

- Properly labeled form fields
- Accessible field instructions
- Logical tab order

## Repair vs. Redesign

Sometimes repairing a broken PDF is possible. Other times, rebuilding from scratch is faster and more effective.

If a document is heavily image-based or poorly structured, redesigning it with accessibility in mind may take only a few hours and yield much better results.

You can also:

- Use built-in accessibility tools in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat
- Outsource PDF tagging and remediation services
- Use PDF accessibility checkers (e.g., PAC, PAVE, etc.)

## Common Structural Tags in PDFs

PDFs use a tagging system similar to HTML:

- Headings (H1, H2…)
- Paragraphs
- Lists
- Tables
- Figures (images)

Without these tags, the document becomes unreadable to assistive technologies.

## Visual Bias and the Autopilot Problem

PDFs are often created visually in tools like Word or InDesign and exported without considering structure. Designers assume the document is usable because it looks correct.

This “visual bias” leads to:

- Incorrect reading order
- Layer conflicts
- Missing structural elements

Accessibility must be intentional — not automatic.

## Alternatives Can Be More Accessible

Sometimes the best solution is not just fixing the PDF.

Consider offering:

- HTML versions
- eBook versions
- Audio versions
- Structured web content

Users may consume content differently (e.g., listening on a bus). Accessibility includes understanding context of use, not just document format.

## Testing Is Essential

PDF accessibility must be tested just like websites and mobile apps.

Use:

- Automated checkers
- Screen reader testing
- Real user testing

Accessibility is not confirmed until users with disabilities can successfully navigate and complete tasks.

## Key Takeaway

PDF accessibility is not optional.

Most PDFs are inaccessible by default, but the solutions are clear:

- Use proper tagging
- Structure documents logically
- Add alt text and metadata
- Label forms
- Test thoroughly

Accessible PDFs ensure critical information is available to everyone — not just those who can see the page visually.
